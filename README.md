# TwitterNameGenerator

##Description##
Group Angular Challenge
ALL RIGHT! Set up a NEW project! From the ground up. Bring in Angular and Express that's all we will need for our project today (unless you do Pro mode).

##Business Need:##
I am the CTO at Snafu Inc. and here at Snafu we want all of our developers to be internet famous. Our trouble is our developers aren't the creative types and have ended up with handles like @joeltmiller (no bueno).

##Technical Requirements##
Our application will randomly generate Twitter handles using two lists of at least 10 (one being adjectives and one being nouns). These two JSON lists should be retrieved from two different Express endpoints using $http. On the server, the names and adjectives should be looked up from a Postgres database.

You should end up with 10 unique twitter handles that will link out to there actual twitter page (so we can check if it's taken, duh).
